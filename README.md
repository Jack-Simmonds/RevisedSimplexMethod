# Revised Simplex Method (2025)
Fully developed phase 1 - phase 2 revised simplex method that solves any feasible linear program to optimality.
Edge-case (unboundedness/infeasibility) detection with early termination.
Optimised for efficient computation using Ï€ matrix calculation.

# How to use:
MATLAB scripts - 





# Model improvements:
B^-1 calculation can be further optimised via Gauss-Jordan elimination.
Preprocessing heuristics, such as redundant constraint removal, variable elimination, and dual problem solving, could be included to improve solving performance.
